I touch to everything that's open source source and I love the mentality, trying step by step to help that world to grow..

- <img src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/selfhst/icons/svg/docker.svg" width="20" height="20"> Maintain the homeserver I built at home using docker to use services from the OSS community.

- <img src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/selfhst/icons/svg/jellyfin.svg" width="20" height="20"> I hoard ***every*** media that I like/think it should not be forgotten so as this *shitty world* evolves, I can watch Cars, HTTYD and play Outer Wilds whenever and wherever I want

- I try to build little apps for folks like me that hoard or have a homelab (currently I have only [bulktranscode](https://github.com/Verymadlibrarian/bulktranscode))
